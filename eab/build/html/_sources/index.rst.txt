EasyBuy's Product List Documentation
=====================================

This documentation page shows all the details of the product list (home page) of our EasyBuy e-commerce web
appication.

 * In this product list page all the products added in our database directory will be visible.
 * There will be a block for each product showing the name, image, description of the product.
 * The products will be seperated by category as specified in the database.
 * There will be slide view of the products.
 * On both sides of a slide there will be arrow which will arrow the user to navigate and search through products.
 * The blocks will have option of quick view and add to cart.
 * By clicking on the button "Quick View" user will be navigated to the product view/detail page.
 * The logic behind how products will be shown on the home page through slides is,

   if, number of item = n,
       The slides number will be n//4+1, (n is not divisible by 4)
       The slides number will be n//4, (n is divisible by 4)

   The formula used in the index function (views.py) to implement slide view of products is,
       nslides =  n//4 + ceil (n/4-n//4); here ciel is the least integer number.
